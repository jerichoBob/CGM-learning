# app1

Just working on a project structure to keep everything organized & properly separated. 
Found a nice starter project structure (https://levelup.gitconnected.com/8-simple-steps-to-build-your-first-streamlit-app-91fe7b3bef9e) here, but it'll need to be adatped.

```
math-problem-generator
│
├── .streamlit
│   └── config.toml
│
├── app
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
│
├── assets
│
├── data
│
└── requirements.txt
```

Would love a little tool like create-react-app (create-streamlit-app?) to do this for me :D
