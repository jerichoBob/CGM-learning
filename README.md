# CGM-learning
A repo for my research on CGM (Circumgalactic Medium)

I am beginning work with Rongmon Bordoloi's research group @ NC State.  This will be where I keep my notes. Will open it up if that seems appropriate.

## Papers
## Some New Terms (for me)
   * **Column Density** - [here](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Column+Density) - a measure of the amount of intervening matter between an observer and the object being observed.
   * **Lyman alpha forest** - [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman-alpha_forest) - The Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar spectra result from intergalactic gas through which the galaxy or quasar's light has traveled. Since neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium are at different degrees of redshift (due to their varying distance from Earth), their absorption lines are observed at a range of wavelengths. Each individual cloud leaves its fingerprint as an absorption line at a different position in the observed spectrum.
   * **Virial Theorem** - [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem) -   relates the average over time of the total kinetic energy of a stable system of discrete particles, bound by potential forces (forces characterized exclusively by potential difference), with that of the total potential energy of the system.
   * **Virial Radius** - here - The virial radius of a gravitationally bound astrophysical system is the radius within which the virial theorem applies. It is defined as the radius at which the density is equal to the critical density .
     * how is this different from [Hill Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere) / [Roche Lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe)?
       * nice explanation of Hill Sphere vs Roche Lobe [here](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/47907/whats-the-difference-between-the-roche-lobe-and-roche-sphere).
   * **Critical Density** - [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations#Density_parameter) - The density parameter Ω is defined as the ratio of the actual (or observed) density ρ to the critical density ρc of the Friedmann universe. The relation between the actual density and the critical density determines the overall geometry of the universe
   * **Galactic Mass/Virial Mass/Virial Radius** - nice commentary [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/406867/intuitive-understanding-of-the-virial-radius-mass) - 
     * excerpt: The basic problem of defining the mass of a galaxy is that the density decreases from the center and out, but never reaches zero. Hence, there is no well-defined radius at which to stop counting particles, so when you say "the actual mass", this concept doesn't really exist.
     * **Virial mass**
     * **Overdensity mass**
     * **Half-light mass**
   * odd turn of phrase: **3 decades in stellar mass** - 
   * **"L*, sub-L*, - What is L⋆?"**: Anatomy of the Galaxy Luminosity Function (2005) - Asantha Cooray AND Milos Milosavljevic 
   * **DLA** - Damped Lyman Alpha
     * A ground-based imaging study of galaxies causing damped Lyman α (DLA), sub-DLA and Lyman limit system absorption in quasar spectra*
     * Column Density: N ~ 20
   * **LLS** - Lyman Limit System
   * **z-index / redshift**
